# large-file-dictionary-attack

A clojure library providing example implementation of dictionary attack.

## Technical notes

Current version (dictionary-attack-java-nio-lines) is a single thread implementation using java.nio.file.Files/lines method for io operations.

Previous version (dictionary-attack-line-seq) is a single thread implementation using BufferedReader and lazy sequences. This implementation is slower then the first one (dictionary-attack-java-nio-lines) - results in section "Test results".

## Possible improvements

1. Method java.nio.file.Files/readAllBytes could be used instead of java.nio.file.Files/lines. Based on this article: https://funnelgarden.com/java_read_file/#Performance_Summary.
1. try-fn predicate verification could be done in parallel. This improvement can bring benefits if try-fn requires take more time then io operations. It is applicable if multiple processor are available on the machine.
1. If io operations are performance bottle neck instead of plain text dictionary, compressed dictionary can be used. In this approach a compressed dictionary is stored on the disk. Dictionary is read and decompressed before performing computation.
