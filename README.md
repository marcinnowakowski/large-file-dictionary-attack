# large-file-dictionary-attack

A clojure library providing example implementation of dictionary attack.

## Technical notes

Current version is simplest possible single thread implementation using lazy sequence. Two aspects of solution are important:
1. Thanks to use of lazy sequence small amount of memory is used. Whole possibly large list of passwords is not loaded to memory at once. 
1. For reading a dictionary file java.io.BufferedReader is used. Default implementation of java.io.BufferedReader sets buffer size to 8k which is optimal for disk io operations.

## Possible improvements

1. Using java.nio package for faster reading of dictionary file. 
1. Implementing parallel execution of predicate verification. Useful if predicate verification takes more time then io operations.
1. Use compression for dictionary file if io operations are performance bottle neck. In this approach compressed dictionary file is stored on disk and during it is read and decompressed.
